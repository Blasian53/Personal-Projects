# Personal-Projects
This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and projects as an aspiring data scientist. 
It contains a collection of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization projects that demonstrate my proficiency in various areas of data science. 
Each project is organized in its own directory, with a corresponding README file providing an overview and instructions for running the code.
